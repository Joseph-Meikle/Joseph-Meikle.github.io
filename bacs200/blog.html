    <p class="blockquote center text-center font-weight-bolder mr-3">"We work in 21 countries around the world alongside local farmers and business owners. We support farmers and their communities as they mobilize and envision their futures, provide training so they can improve the quantity and quality of the goods they produce, and connections to market to increase sales and incomes."</p>
    
    <p>World hunger has always been one of the predominant big problems in the world. Giving food to those who need it is always a good thing to do, but part of what makes Heifer so great is that they help create long term solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Heifer gives livestock to farmers who need it most, and gives them the technology and training they need to be able to better provide for themselves and their community. And because these animals will grow and reproduce, soon more and more people in the community can have animals for themselves and the cycle continues.</p>
    <p>Heifer also helps build women empowerment in the contries they work in. They will help women build and develop their own businesses which will ultimately feed back into their families and community.</p>

    <h2 class="font-weight-bolder">Underlying Issues</h2>
    <p>In the modern world, even with the current population, 
        <a href="https://foodfirst.org/publication/we-already-grow-enough-food-for-10-billion-people-and-still-cant-end-hunger/">humans produce enough food to feed 10 billion people.</a>
        This raises the quesiton: why do 
        <a href="https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/losing-25000-hunger-every-day">25,000 people still starve to death every day?</a></p> 
    <h4>Many people have different answers to this question:</h4> 
    <ul>
        <li>Even though humans produce enough food to feed everyone, it's not often produced in the places where people need it the most. More than the food itself, there's a high demand of resources to distribute food to every single person in the world. Some people live in rural areas that are hard to get to and even harder to consistently bring large amounts of food to. Others live in crowded urban cities with poorer governments that can't afford to provide food to everyone who needs is. This last point feeds into the next argument.</li>
        <li>Vast economic disparity causes some groups to have more food than they could eat in a hundred lifetimes, if they so chose, and other groups to suffer from malnourishment and ultimately starve to death. This happens on all levels. In America, one of the richest countries in the world, over 10% of households are food insecure, while the top 1% wealthiest people in the country have a combined net worth of $34.2 trillion. That's a lot of steaks. On a larger scale, one again, America is one the wealthiest countries in the world, controlling far more of the global economy than any other country and close to the highest PPP share in the world, while, once again, many countries can't afford to feed their own people.</li>
        <li>A bit more cynical than the other points. The world we live in is largely motivated by greed and selfishness. Those in power often care more about maintaining their own wealth or power than helping others. Building on the last point, a tiny fraction of the world's population has more wealth than the rest of the world combined, yet they generally don't care enough to help the people who really need it, even the people who's backs their life is built upon. Similarly, many corportations wouldn't bat an eye if millions of people starved because the prices on their food are too high, so long as they make as much money as they can. Nestle does this exact thing with water. Controlling it in rural countries and charging astronomical prices on it, since people cannot live without it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-weight-bolder">Creating Solutions</h2>
    <p>There's ongoing debate on how to solve these problems. Some people have called for economic policies to help redistribute wealth within countries with vast economic disparity, but others argue it simply wouldn't work. Some argue that the UN or some other large entity should pump more money into poorer countries, but others argue that it would be pointless without the proper structres in place to use that money effectively. Many have called for a strong crackdown on scummy corporate tactics that companies like Nestle uses, but other have argued once again it simply wouldn't work so there's no point in trying. The grim truth for many of these solutions is that, no matter how effective they might be, many of the solutions may never see the light of day for years to come.</p>
    <h4>Enter Heifer</h4>
    <p>Heifer does a great job at addressing all these problems in a way that has worked wonders and changed countless lives. They solve the resource/transportation problem by bringing the source of the food right to the people they're helping. They also help people build up their own businesses, giving power back to the smaller communities and away from powerful monopolies. And, they're able to act now, and have been for decades.</p>
