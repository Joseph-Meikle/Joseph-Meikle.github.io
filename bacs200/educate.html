    <p>I figured I'd start with my all time favorite TED Talk, with James Veitch. Here, he takes you through his journey replying to scam emails and trying to drag them on and on wasting as much of the scammer's time as he can. The moral, presented at the end, is very inspiring:</p>
    <p><emp>"Do do this at home. Do do this at home... because not only do you have a chance to stop them from doing actual damage, but it's also a chance to have fun, to play."</emp></p>

    <h3>Kyle McDonald - What if You Could Trade a Paperclip for a House></h3>

        <p>This is another TED Talk I very much enjoy, where Kyle McDonald takes you through his process of trading away his red paperclip for a fish pen, and trading for bigger and better things until he gets a house. Like the James Veitch video, this makes me want to try the same thing and see if I achieve the same results. So, if anyone has a fish pen they want to trade away just let me know. :)

    <h2>TED Ed</h2>

        For the other videos, I decided to go with TED Ed videos. I occassionally watch TED Ed in my free time, and these are some of my favorite videos.

    <h3>Alex Gendler - Plato's Allegory of the Cave</h3>

        Plato's Allegory of the Cave has always intrigued me, and this video is a great explanation of it. Even today people will often actively resist seeing a broader scope of the world, whether it's thinking about the world as a planet in the enormous universe, or even thinking about the world outside of the United States. It's facinating to see how often this relates to stuff in media, or life.

    <h3>Alex Gendler - Can You Solve the Prisoner Hat Riddle?</h3>
    <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vJSNXPEwA" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p> I don't love all of these riddle videos, because occasionally the answer will bring in a third component, but many of these riddles I do very much enjoy. This is one of the latter, with a very tricky but not unreasonable solution. Can you figure it out?
