        He may not be a super influential historical figure, he may not even be historical, being alive and well today, but Hanz Zimmer is my hero.

        Hans Zimmer is a music composer that's possibly best known for the Inception 'BWOOONG' or anything from Interstellar, but many people don't realize just how much he's done for movies throughout his career. Many of his compositions people are familiar with, but not under his name.

    <p>
        Some examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Pirates of the Caribbean theme (and any other music from the franchise) </li>
        <li>The Wonder Woman theme</li>
        <li>The score from The Lion King</li>
        <li>Driving Miss Daisy</li>
        <li>The Electro Suite (and any other music from The Amazing Spider Man 2)</li>
        <li>Sherlock Holmes (The Robert Downey Jr. one)</li>
        <li>The score from The Prince of Egypt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Besides all this he's done countless scores for movies, with more famous ones such as Inception, Interstellar, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Man of Steel, and Gladiator, as well as more unknown works such as 12 Years a Slave, Le Petit Prince, and endless others that I won't list because I've already proven I know how to do lists.

        I'm a fan of everything he's made, but what really puts him into 'hero' status in my eyes is what he puts into each of his songs. If his repertoire shows anything it's that he's able to make scores in virtually any style, or mix of styles, but what's also interesting is that you can often tell if a song is Hans Zimmer's or not. He puts his heart into his pieces and you can tell. Many of his pieces he'll tell you have a personal connection to himself. When he was asked to write the score for the Lion King he was initially hesitant to do the music for an animated Disney movie (imagining the old Disney fairytale movies and whatnot) but in the end he realized the story was about a boy losing his father, and ended up incorporating his own relationship with his father into the piece. I find that truly incredible and I think it's amazing how he's able to, to this day, create amazing score after amazing score.
